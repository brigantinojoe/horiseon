# Horiseon Marketing

## Description
Horiseon Marketing requested a custom website to display their company services and benefits. Horiseon Marketing company started a few months ago and by word of mouth, they grew quickly to become one of the best marketing firms in San Diego. As their clientele grew, so did their need for a easy-to-access website with their company information. I learned how important it is to build a website while leaving bread-crumbs for future developers to improve and maintain it. Making comments and organizing sections of code based on the websites' user interface, I believe any beginner would be able to pick up where I left off. 

## Installation
No installation necessary. Please visit [this website](https://brigantinojoe.github.io/horiseon/#social-media-marketing) to view the published website. The project was created in HTML 5 and CSS, and published using Github Pages.

## Usage
To navigate the website, use the menu bar on the rop right corner of the web-page. The navigation bar will quickly move your focus to other sections of the website.
